Grading Policy

### Regular Exams

There will be **three** exams during the semester, each comprising 15% of your final grade. Exams will emphasize topics presented in lecture. However, any material in the assigned reading is fair game.

### Final Exam

There will be a final exam covering all of the material during the semester. Emphasis will be on a synthesis of the subject material. Your previous exams will be your best guide to the most important topics.

### Homework

There will be regular homework problem sets, averaging about 1 per week.

### Attendance and Class Participation

Occasional attendance will be taken. Class participation by everyone is encouraged!
